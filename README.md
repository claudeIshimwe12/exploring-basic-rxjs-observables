# Exploring Basic Rxjs Observables

In this project, I derved deep into RxJS Operators like of, from, interval, distinctUnitlChanged, take, tap and many more.

I also tried to practice what I learned by mimicing the get method offered by httpClient Module, I tried to make like an api call request using RxJS operator to generate a brand new Observable.

There is a simple UI that has search input form, which allows the user to search all posts based on the post title or post description details.
